# Enrico Andrade portfolio
## Videographer | Video editor | Photographer

The main idea of the website is to showcase Enrico's Skills as a videographer to attract potential employers.

The main challenges of this projects was:
  - Adding text over images.
  - Hidding images and content for the mobile version.
  - Adding a video as a header on the portfolio page.

To overcome this issues I did some research on w3Schools to learn how to add a video on html, and I also watch some lessons on brighspace to recap how to use [POSITION RELATIVE and ABSOLUTE]. In addition, I had to convert the video to MP4, with a bitrate of 4000, reducing the video size to load the page faster. 
Also, I have used bootstrap to build the nav bar.

[For this project I have used images that I shot for MTM6101 Introduction to Photography assignments and also a video teaser of some jobs that I made back in Brazil.]
